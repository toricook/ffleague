title: "Painting has begun on playoff picture"
---
Anisha and Maya, my beautiful sister and my sister, have become the first team to clinch playoff berth and the first team to be mathematically eliminated from the playoffs, respectively. Anisha came into this season an underdog, never having reached the playoffs before despite being a member of the league since its inauguration 2018. With a 9-1 record, Like Jesus at Red Rocks won 6 straight games before being taken down by 4 Hr Independent Study in her only loss to date. Anisha's team has been led to greatness mainly by her two quarterbacks, Jalen Hurts and Justin Fields, the QB3 and QB4 of the season so far. Maya, another league veteran, also entered the season with low expectations. Though officially a co-manager with Jackson, Maya took on more of a solo role this year. Unluckily, her first round draft pick Najee Harris ended up being a bust, and her top scoring player is Daniel Jones, currently the QB16. In the draft recap, it was noted that Maya's reluctance to draft a QB early could be a weakness and it seems that those predictions have come true. As the youngest manager in the league, Maya is still maturing and may yet become a force to be reckoned with in future seasons.
