Though the controversial trade between Allen Work and No Play and Rowan’s Terrific Team had its detractors, there were ultimately not enough vetoes to prevent it from going through. On Sunday, Beyonce’s birthday of all days, Rowan gave up her number one draft pick Dalvin Cook for the 17th drafted quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, in what one manager called “a highway robbery” and another called “a huge blow for feminism.” There’s no doubt that Rowan needed a starting QB badly, though with several teams carrying an extra QB that they probably would have given up for a price, one wonders whether Rowan spent enough time in negotiations. It’s also unfortunate for everyone else that Allen’s gamble of using his first two rounds on QBs is not looking like much of a gamble anymore since he now also has an elite RB to add to his lineup. Allen’s manager Brian is currently in delinquent status for failing to pay the 2021 entry fee.
