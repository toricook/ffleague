"On Wednesday, Dak went out to play in the yard for the first time since injuring his right paw in Week 1. He was seen favoring his uninjured left paw during some "light fetching", though he did not practice with the team.  After speaking to reporters that told him that his receivers said his passes had some pop on them, he replied "I always got some pop on my balls. I'm not going to throw if I ain't got pop on my balls. WOOF!" Dak, of course, does not have balls, so this quote does raise some questions about his mental state but at least he is in high spirits. Dak said he felt "great" after his fetching session, but coach Mike McCarthy made it clear that Dak is only in the rehab phase. "We have to trust the medical process," McCarthy said, "and that process involves playing Cooper Rush right now because he is better. Dak needs to rest a lot so that we can keep winning." The NFL Canine Players Association did not have any comment.
