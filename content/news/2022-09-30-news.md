title: "Yahoo! found not responsible for manager failures"
---
"After an extensive internal review, the Yahoo! Fantasy platform was found not responsible for Maya and Jackson's poor performance as co-managers throughout the life of this league. The duo have consistently finished in the bottom third, their best finish being 8th place in 2019, a year which saw the league padded with several Killing Eve fans who had never heard of football. Maya alleges that it's the Yahoo! platform that has kept her from performing to her fullest potential. "The fact is that there is simply no mechanic on the platform that would affect Maya any differently than the other managers," said Cory Took, head of the investigative committee. "Furthermore, no specific complaint about the platform has been lodged by Maya or anyone else." A separate committee has been formed to evaluate new platforms for a potential 2023 switch, but the commissioner made it clear that those plans were in the works prior to Maya's filing. "We are not in the business of making sweeping changes based on the complaints of a single manager, no matter how annoying they may be," said the commisioner in an official statement. No reparations will be given to Maya at this time.
