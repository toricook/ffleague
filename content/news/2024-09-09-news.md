title: "New website ushers in new era for the league"
---

 After the devastation wrought by storage limitatons imposed by UC Berkeley on losers who are still using their college email address (an incident many have compared to the burning of the Library of Alexandria), a new website has been launched for fantasy footballers to keep up on the latest league updates. Though many aspects of the site remain under construction, today's deployment offered the promise of many exiciting features to come. "Switching to a custom website was the obvious choice," said commissioner Tori Cook at the press conference where the site was unveiled. "The Indian developers I hired were dirt cheap. They've never watched a football game in their lives, but goddamit they work hard." It remains to be seen how the league members will react to the new website, though the usual group of naysayers will undoubtedly enjoy the link to file issue reports in the footer."
